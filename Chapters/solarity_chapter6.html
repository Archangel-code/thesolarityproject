  <h3>Chapter 6 – Departure</h3>
    
  <p><span class="comment">The mongoose raced through the devastated streets. Sand whipped along the side of the Vehicle, old metal facades passed by like ghosts. Buildings – which are half ruins now. I looked ahead – the UCF tower was not even visible.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"The way I see it... the facility is REALLY damn far away."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana reported directly from my HUD.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"That's right. Even MUCH further than you walked from the beach to the city."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I frowned.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"How long do we need even at this speed?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Short arithmetic.</span> <span class="spoken cortana">"About... one to two days."</span></p>
  
  <p>Me, almost rigid. <span class="spoken philipp">"Are you serious?"</span></p>
  
  <p>In my HUD, a small animated thumbs up appeared.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">An emoji. I laughed dryly.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"At least you have a sense of humor."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She got in touch again.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"We need to make some stopovers anyway. I discovered a halfway intact area nearby. It's a ruin, but protected from wind and storm. You could put your feet up."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I thought for a moment.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"And the monsters?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">"None of them are anywhere near that position."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Then I nodded. <span class="spoken philipp">"Sounds fair."</span></p>
  
  <p>Cortana guided me through a half-collapsed side gate. I drove the Mongoose in. I took a deep breath.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">For the first time in hours. <span class="spoken philipp">"Okay... what do we do now?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Then she said nonchalantly.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"You're... resting. In the meantime, I might find a few... surprises for us here."</span></p>
  
  <p>I just sat there for a while. The air smelled... of dust and metal, but not of danger. Then I rolled out the blanket and slowly sank backward. My body creaked, not my suit. It was the first time I&#x27;d lain down... since I fell from the sky. No surface had ever felt good before.</p>
  
  <p>But this – that was the moment when my body realized how long it had actually been running. I closed my eyes for a moment.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">But my thoughts... stayed awake. <span class="spoken philipp">"Hey... Cortana?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">"Huh?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken philipp">"What is the name of this planet anyway?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">"Arellia."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I blinked. <span class="spoken philipp">"Arellia... "</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">For some reason, the word Arellia became familiar to me. The word, not the name.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Sounds... beautiful."</span></p>
  
  <p>Arellia. The center of the greatest political and military power in this multiverse. Possibly also of all of them, as well as of all realities. Cortana told me more The United Coalition and The United Coalition Forces, UC and UCF. The planet&#x27;s size could be compared to Jupiter. The Cities are gigantic. The two moons are not as densely populated because they are Wildlife protected... but more like resorts. Beyond them – the pale gray, violet-shimmering atmosphere of these planets.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I mumbled halfway. <span class="spoken philipp">"It&#x27;s a shame that I&#x27;m only here when it&#x27;s all over."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana answered quietly.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Not quite, you might be able to see a small part of it in the HQ."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I turned slightly to the side. Smiled. <span class="spoken philipp">"Yes, maybe"</span></p>
  
  <p>I closed my eyes. Just for a moment. And at this moment... Arellia was not just a name. It was the place where my story just began anew.</p>
  
  <p>But then, it’s like my body shuts itself out. I suddenly had no control. Darkness it´s engulfing my view, not like in the mall.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Then... </span>
  <span class="spoken philipp">"AHHHHHHH!!! WAS ZUR HÖLLE!"</span><br />
  <span class="translation philipp" style="margin-left: 50px;">//AHHHHHHH!!! WHAT THE HELL!//</span></p>
  
  <p>It´s like I have been woken up. Like I was sleeping? My WHOLE BODY was dripping swear. But WHY!?</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I noticed that Cortana was sitting next to me.She had that concerned Face again.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Are you OK? What happened!?!?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I am as confused as she is. <span class="spoken philipp">"I don't know… I don’t remember…"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">"You don’t remember having a nightmare?!"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I was more than confused <span class="spoken philipp">"A what now?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana then showed me a holographic image of my Vitals.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Your brain was lit like a rocket exiting the atmosphere. Those waves indicate that you had a nightmare."</span></p>
 
  <p><span class="comment">Well, one that I have no memory of.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Normally I remember dream or nightmares but here… not even a small fragment is left behind. Maybe that nightmare was so bad that my brain refuses to let me remember that?"</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">Now she looks like that she is processing that.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"That… can be possible. In some cases, nightmares can lead to some sort of dream insomnia."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Well, I guess I nothing to worry about for now.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Maybe it’s for the best, not to remember that."</span></p>
  
  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p><span class="comment">A few minutes passed in silence until I suddenly remember.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Tell me... what’s up about your surprises? That you mentioned earlier?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Her smile became a little more mischievous.</span></p>
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Oh yes... I almost forgot about it."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She slowly stretched out her hand.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Come with me. I'll show you."</span></p>
  
  <p>Hesitantly, I raised my hand. Our fingers met. I was about to say something – when she pulled me up. Not by force. She hadn&#x27;t let go.</p>

  <p><span class="comment">I looked at her. She looked at me and smiled.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Come."</span></p>
  
  <p>Then she turned around, still holding my hand. And she went off, pulling me in. Slow. Quiet.</p>

  <p>The corridors became wider. Then we stepped through an open arch – and I stopped. Concourse. But not as I knew them. Huge. Broken. Partly overgrown. But in their midst – light. A glow so bright and soft at the same time that I had to blink. I couldn&#x27;t see what it was – Cortana was running right in front of me. As if she had planned it all. As if this moment wasn&#x27;t accidental.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Then we stopped. <span class="spoken cortana">"Okay... here it is."</span></p>
  
  <p>Slowly, she let go of my hand. She stepped aside, and then... I saw it. I gasped for air – and forgot to exhale. A tree, a huge, luminous, pulsating tree. Its trunk was silvery-white, slightly transparent, as if made of crystal. But it was its leaves that paralyzed me: pink-violet. Dancing gently in the light. They shimmered as if each one carried a memory. It was... beautiful. I approached slowly. I looked up – and for a moment, I forgot everything. Arellia, the shadows, the past.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana stepped next to me again. Her voice was calm. Almost reverently.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"This tree... was a gift. From the Na&#x27;vi at –"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I said it automatically, without looking at her. <span class="spoken philipp">"– Pandora."</span></p>
  
  <p>My eyes were glued to the light, to the leaves that danced softly in the invisible wind.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana looked at me – and smiled gently.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Yes, exactly. But... you don't know certainly for what."</span></p>
  
  <p>I frowned slightly, but I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off.</p>

  <p><span class="comment">She continued.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"This tree... was a thank you. The UCF has helped defend their planet. Before they get wiped out by the– "</span></p>
  
  <p>She looked at me, expecting me to intervene again. But I didn&#x27;t this time. I was much too perplexed by the tree, as if it had hypnotized me.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana smiled and continued.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">" – RDA. The United Coalition had even tried to establish contact with their Earth, with some nation from there. They had also tried to contact the RDA again, to offer help with their dying Earth, but everything was ignored."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">My gaze was still hypnotic.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Then, the Omatikaya&#x27;s Tree of Souls lost a trunk. The strange thing is that it didn&#x27;t die. It was like... it wanted to be taken away. The Omatikaya then understood that their tree wanted it that way, as a kind of thankful gesture."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">That surprised me. <span class="spoken philipp">"A strange kind of gratitude."</span></p>
  
  <p>It shimmered even brighter, as if it had heard the words.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I whispered to Cortana. <span class="spoken philipp">"And? Is it still there?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She was silent for a moment. <span class="spoken cortana">"What do you mean?"</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">I smiled at that.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Tree of Souls is part of a mind. The Na&#x27;vi call it Eywa. Their version of Mother Nature, only that it is actually a mind. I wonder... whether some of it has reached this point... is there."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment"></span>Cortana understood, roughly. <span class="spoken cortana">"You feel it, don't you?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I didn&#x27;t know if what I was feeling was really IT.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"I don't know..."</span></p>
  
  <p>I took a step closer. The air changed. Thicker und Clearer. The leaves flickered in gentle waves – and for a split second, I thought they had reacted to my approach.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I slowly stretched out a hand. Uncertain. Reverent.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Maybe..."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I murmured softly. <span class="spoken philipp">"It wants us to talk to us..."</span></p>

  <p>Cortana stood quietly next to me, she didn&#x27;t look back. Her gaze was fixed on the tree. To the glowing leaves that trembled gently in the invisible wind. And then I touched him. My fingertips touched the wood.</p>
  
  <p>And at that moment – not even a second later – everything disappeared into –</p>
  
  <p class="transition">[ – Darkness]</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment"></span>Not a darkness like in the mall, no night. But a complete absence of everything. Like an empty space between the breaths of the world. I stumbled because the floor is strangely soft. Moist like fog that lay under the feet.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"CORTANA!?"</span></p>
  
  <p>My voice echoed into nothingness. I turned around,nothing, no exit, not even any light.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">But then – a voice spoke to me.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken friendly">//Your fall on Arellia is no coincidence. But also no predestination.//</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">The voice wasn&#x27;t loud, but it was everywhere.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken friendly">//The journey will be difficult at times, sometimes easy. Sometimes brutal... but also wonderful.//</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">I stared into the dark, didn&#x27;t know where to look.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken friendly">//But one thing is certain. Your journey... has... still... not... started.//</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I breathed. <span class="spoken philipp">"What?"</span></p>
  
  <p class="transition">[Blinded by bright light]</p>
  
  <p>I stood in front of the tree again.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana was standing next to me, slightly confused. <span class="spoken cortana">"What do you mean by what?"</span></p>
  
  <p>I took a deep breath. My skin still shimmered and I felt slightly dizzy. The air seemed thicker, the tree calmer. And my heart... something had changed.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I turned to Cortana. <span class="spoken philipp">"How long... was I gone?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She frowned slightly. <span class="spoken cortana">"Gone?"</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">I nodded. <span class="spoken philipp">"Exactly. I was... somewhere else."</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">She answered slowly, as if she didn&#x27;t quite believe what she was saying.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Not at all. Not even for a second. Your arm was still on the bark, your gaze was fixed... and then suddenly you said something."</span></p>
  
  <p>I took a step back. The tree – stood still, glowed softly, as if nothing had happened.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">But inside me... everything was different.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Quick. Check my vitals. More precisely, my brain."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She looked at me askance for a moment, but did it anyway. I felt the suit hum. A slight pulsation. Cortana began to analyze data.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"What do you see?"</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">A few seconds passed. Then a visual representation appeared. And Cortana didn&#x27;t sound surprised, but... pensive.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Interesting. At the moment of your touch... there was a rash. Not like an epileptic impulse. Rather... like a complete REM-state."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">It certainly wasn&#x27;t a sleep. <span class="spoken philipp">"So... a dream like back then?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She sounded confident.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"No. It was too clear for that, too structured. Your brain was... completely synchronized – as if you were processing between two places at the same time in a fully active state."</span></p>
  
  <p>I said nothing. I didn&#x27;t have to say anything either. Because I knew: This was not just an impression. It was a contact, a moment, a signal. Cortana watched me closely.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She was calm, but her eyes sought mine.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"What did you see?"</span></p>
  
  <p>I hesitated. Not because I was afraid – but because I had to process it.</p>

  <p><span class="comment">Piece by piece.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Everything was black. Empty. And I was alone."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana didn&#x27;t say anything. She let me talk.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"I called for you. But you were gone. There was only... I think it was Eywa. It spoke to me."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I looked at her.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"It said my fall on Arellia was no coincidence. But also, no predestination."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana frowned slightly, but continued to listen attentively.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"It said... my journey will be difficult and wonderful."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I faltered.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"And then she said... But one thing is certain... Your journey... still… has... not... started."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Silence.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"I don't know. But I feel also... that everything I've experienced so far... was only the prelude."</span></p>
  
  <p class="transition">[Sometime later]</p>
  
  <p>We were on the road again. The Mongoose rolled over old roads, between fallen signs, time-scarred facades and whispering winds that carried sand through the urban canyons.</p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken friendly">\\<i>Your journey... still… has... not... started</i>\\</span></p>
  
  <p>This sentence hung like an echo in my head. As if set in stone. If what I had already lived through wasn&#x27;t the beginning, what was it? A prologue? A test? I thought. Too much. Too deep. And then – my body jerked to the right. The suit suddenly moved by itself, automatically counter steering. The Mongoose dodged a collapsed metal support that was lying on the road as if out of nowhere.</p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken philipp">"Whoa!"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana&#x27;s voice then came in my head, full of sweet sarcasm.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Well... too much daydreaming? Or did you mentally hold hands with that tree again?\\</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I grimaced. <span class="spoken philipp">"Ha ha, very funny."</span></p>

  <p><span class="spoken cortana">\\I think I&#x27;m hilarious\\</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I grinned – half annoyed, half grateful.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"By the way, thanks for the automatic correction... otherwise I would have driven into a wall right away."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">\\Nothing to thank. I noticed in your brain pattern five seconds before that you were drifting away. What exactly are you thinking all the time?\\</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I became quiet again.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Because of yesterday. I'm just trying... to find out what all this may mean."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana was silent for a moment. <span class="spoken cortana">\\Welcome to the club.\\</span></p>
  
  <p>The ride seemed like an endless loop to me, half a wasteland after another. With the hope that it will end one day.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Then Cortana&#x27;s voice came suddenly. <span class="spoken cortana">\\STOP!\\</span></p>
  
  <p>No discussion. I immediately hit the brakes. The Mongoose came to a halt with a jerk. Dust swirled up, sand scraped under the tires.</p>
 
  <p><span class="comment">I asked, while my heartbeat slowly accelerated.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"What's going on? Is there anything here?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She then in a jerky voice.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Multiple motion pings... from different directions. Coming faster than the Mongoose\\</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">I was immediately on my feet. The suit reacted quickly. I jumped off the Mongoose, grabbed my gun from my back and loaded through.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Where exactly?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">A brief moment of silence.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\I can&#x27;t say. We&#x27;re... literally surrounded\\</span></p>
  
  <p>I lowered myself a little. Eyes scanned the surroundings. Between broken buildings, collapsed bridge remains, overgrown metal and shadows. Nothing moved. But I felt it, as if the air is holding its breath.</p>
 
  <p><span class="comment">Like when something is watching you – just waiting for you to make the first move.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Cortana... can you do another scan of the surroundings?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I heard the slight buzzing in the suit as sensors went up.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Already there\\</span></p>

  <p>Exoskeleton&#x27;s target assistant went on. My hands were resting quietly on the weapon</p>
  
  <p>There it was again. This inhumanly distorted sound, as if taken from hell itself. Just like in the library. I whirled around, yanked up my weapon and pointed it at the wide entrance to the building, which gaped like an open maw in the wall. Pitch-dark and deep. So deep that the light of my visor was swallowed up in it. I took a few steps back and sank into a fighting position. Legs offset, shoulders lowered, my fingers lay quietly on the trigger. Then – a second scream from a different direction. Then a third, a fourth, a fifth. And then... a whole orchestra of horror.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Directly from this dark corner. Hundreds of screams.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Oh fucking dammit, not that again."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana answered – strangely calm, but with a depth in her voice that I had never heard before.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Here they come\\</span></p>

  <p>A moment of silence. Then, a dull rumble vibrated from the entrance.</p>
  
  <p>Not loud – but deep. Like a pulse from the darkness. As if a mass were to start moving. I fixed on the target, pointed the weapon – and then they burst forth. The first ones ran as if unleashed. Figures with torn skin, bent limbs, glowing eyes and the scream of something that should no longer have a voice. I fired with precise Single shots. A shot to the head. The next one to the heart. Again, and again. The suit corrected slightly, the servo motors helped stabilize my arms. I was a fortress of control and firepower. Click, magazine empty. Zack,change it. In less than two seconds.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana suddenly called.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Here comes the bigger Wave!\\</span></p>

  <p>I heard it before I saw it. A roar – not of one being, but of hundreds. A collective storm. They burst out of the building, from all sides. Like a black, living storm, raging.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I was a little louder. <span class="spoken philipp">"That's too many!"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana didn&#x27;t scream. But her voice had urgency now.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Run. NOW!\\</span></p>
  
  <p>I reacted. Without thinking, I turned around. The suit ignited the boosters, the speed exploded. The ground seemed to crack under me, the Mongoose shuts down, and i... ran.</p>
  
  <p>The shadows were chasing me, they wanted me. I ran like a champion, as if driven by something alien. My muscles were working at peak performance – but I still felt pain and pressure. The Exo-Suit helped, surely – but I wasn&#x27;t just a passenger. Behind me was the raging, the roaring, the claws tearing the ground apart. I twisted my upper body slightly, raised my weapon, and fired blindly backwards. A few hits, followed by a couple of screams. Their bodies recoiled, but that didn&#x27;t stop the rest.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana suddenly called.<span class="spoken cortana">\\BELOW YOU!\\</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">It went down like a huge hill. I wanted to react to it, but my right foot stepped into nothingness.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">„OH SCHEIßEEEEEEE – !!“</span><br />
  <span class="translation philipp">//OH SHIEEEETTTTTT – !!//</span></p>
  
  <p>I couldn&#x27;t find any foothold, but I somehow managed to throw myself onto my back and slide down the sand in a controlled manner. Not gracefully, but safely. Compared to me, the creatures were unfortunately a little luckier, if you can put it that way. They simply ran down the slope. Like wolves in formation. I turned lying down, aimed uphill, and kept firing. Headshots, one after the other. The hit creatures staggered and then rolled down the slope like bales of hay – some of them directly onto each other.</p>
  
  <p>The end of the sand slide came quickly, and I slid a few more meters over firm, harder ground. No time for a breather. I stood up – with a hiss, the boosters in the suit activated. A short push, and I was fully upright again.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana called.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\10 meters further on your left is an open passage – get in there!\\</span></p>

  <p>The sand dune ended right next to a high-rise building. I saw the main entrance and rushed straight through the open doorway. A wide passageway, how inviting... but this was anything but safe. And yet I paused for a moment. The lobby wasn&#x27;t a cold reception area, it was... impressive. A terrarium of luxury. The reception hall stretched up to the ceiling of the building. Palm trees towered several meters high. In between there were metal seating areas, covered with leather or something that looked like it. But this was no ordinary apartment building. A luxury apartment building, built by those who weren&#x27;t afraid that the world would collapse, or thought they could.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana spoke sharply.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Why are you standing there! The Lift! Quick!\\</span></p>
  
  <p>I saw it – at the far end of the lobby. Half-embedded in a shiny wall of glass. Cortana had already prepared the doors to be open. I sprinted. The sand still on my boots, my breath like fire. I jumped in – and the doors closed right behind me. I staggered against the wall, almost slipping on the polished surface.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment"></span>Gasping, no draught, only sweat and palpitations.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"I have... not for a long time... ran like that... if at all..."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken enemy"><b><i>[BOOOM]</b></i></span></p>
  
  <p>A jarring impact. Several creatures had already been right behind me. They rammed themselves against the elevator door, but it held. The elevator slowly began to ascend.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I gasped questioningly. <span class="spoken philipp">"Which floor?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana on it. <span class="spoken cortana">\\254. There is a UCF-Saferoom there. We can entrench ourselves there\\</span></p>

  <p><span class="comment">I nodded. <span class="spoken philipp">"Okay... okay... "</span></p>
  
  <p>As the elevator ascended, I looked through the transparent walls. From the 100th floor, you could see out. The city – dilapidated, vast, and of a strange, sad beauty. You couldn&#x27;t see the whole thing, but it was enough for a quick glimpse. I looked down, since the elevator and shaft are openly visible.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">And... <span class="spoken philipp">"Cortana...?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">\\Yes?\\</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken philipp">"You didn't happen to... forget that there are stairs here, don't you?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Silence. <span class="spoken cortana">\\Oops\\</span></p>
  
  <p>A spiral staircase, running along the outside of the shaft. They were there. The creatures were climbing slowly, but they were coming. About 50 floors away.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I asked with a tense look at the floor display.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Can you do something about the speed?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">The creatures approached. Cortana hesitated only a moment.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Hold on tight"</span></p>
  
  <p>I grabbed two support poles with both hands, pressed myself against them, bent my knees slightly, and positioned myself firmly. Then it started. A hum, then a hiss. The elevator shot upwards, not gliding, almost like a catapult. Floors whizzed by, the display barely able to keep up. The exosuit reacted, hardening my leg muscles in certain areas to keep me from tipping over. Then – a short scream from the mechanism. The brakes engaged hard, jerkily. The entire shaft vibrated, and I was pulled forward, but I just managed to stay afloat.</p>
  
  <p class="transition">[Floor 254]</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana called.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Go!\\</span></p>
  
  <p>The doors opened, and suddenly I stopped, not even a meter from the door. Just a moment, a thought, an idea. I stared briefly into the void, feeling the pounding in my chest.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana shouted alarmed.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Philipp!?\\</span></p>
  
  <p>But I didn&#x27;t react to her words – I acted. I ran – not further into this floor, but two floors down, as fast as the suit would allow.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">During the run, I spoke loudly.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Cortana! If I stop, I want you to override the boosters under my feet. More energy – and adjusted so that they release the power outwards, not as dampeners!"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">\\Wa-!?\\</span></p>
  
  <p>But she stopped and knew I had some sort of a plan. She began reprogramming as I reached my position – exactly between floors 252 and 251. I stopped, knees bent, both feet firmly planted. And then: Stomp. I kicked the ground as hard as I could. Powerful, precise kicks. One after the other, into the structure. The suit hummed, transmitting the force directly to the ground.</p>

  <p>Cortana finally understood my plan – she amplified the impulses, changed the tread dynamics, and let each impact thunder through the concrete. The stairs began to shake and cracks spread. A rhythmic splintering. The creatures were only 20 floors away. Then, a sharp, drawn-out <b><i>CRACK</i></b>. The structure could take it no longer. I hauled myself up – ran upwards, making a final sprint to floor 252. The stairs collapsed beneath me – whereupon I jumped just in time, grabbed the edge on the stable structure and hung on it. <b><i>I MADE IT</i></b>.</p>

  <p>Before I climbed up, I made a last look down.  Many of the creatures stood at Floor 249, screaming at me. The creature that almost reached me fell into the depth.</p>

  <p><span class="comment">For that moment, I had to make stupid quote. <span class="spoken philipp">“Well... who stomps last...”</span></p>

  <p>With slow steps, still noticeably exhausted, I walked down the hallway.I stood in front of the door to the UCF safe room... which is clearly marked... for a safe room. Next to it is a security panel that glowed softly blue.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Before I could even say or type anything, I heard Cortana&#x27;s voice – warped, almost ghostly, almost crazy.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">\\Ooooopennnnnn Sesameeeeeeeeee~!\\</span></p>
  
  <p>I burst into pent-up, relieved laughter. It wasn&#x27;t even particularly funny, but it was good for a change. A short, whistling hiss – then the door slid silently open. One by one, lights automatically switched on. And what I saw... wasn&#x27;t what I expected. The room looked like an elegant, luxurious apartment. Nothing like the last Saferoom. Glass walls with the to the city. A soft couch. On the wall, a hologram panel that looks like a television. A UCF emblem embedded on the tabletop. A set of marked weapons on the wall – in a locked holder. Terminals blinking crazily as if they were on standby. The kitchen – fully functional. A power generator hummed quietly in the background. Water, electricity, air – everything was there.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I sank down onto the couch. Cortana appeared next to me. <span class="spoken cortana">"Not bad, is it?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">She asked with a smile. I nodded, slowly. <span class="spoken philipp">"I&#x27;ve seen worse hotel rooms."</span></p>
  
  <p>The suit worked silently, supporting me as if it&#x27;s aware of my fatigue. With slightly unsteady steps, I walked toward the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. A quiet hiss, cool air rushed toward me, and... food. Packaging, water bottles, individual dishes – portion-sized, color-coded, some with visible seals.</p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I stared in. <span class="spoken philipp">"70000 years... and the food looks like it was produced yesterday."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana replied, much too calmly, as if she had been waiting for exactly this comment.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"And they are."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I frowned and half turned to her.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"Excuse me?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="spoken cortana">"Even after 70,000 years, many of the automated systems are still running – including the energy supply, air filtration... and also synthetic food production."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I pulled out a packet. A kind of noodle bowl, rice steaming inside, or... what looked like rice. <span class="spoken philipp">"You mean to tell me that&#x27;s still being made?"</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana nodded.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Of course. Everything was built to last. UCF was prepared for extreme scenarios. Post-system-collapse-capable, as they called it."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">I looked at her. A tiny grin flitted across my face.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken philipp">"On my earth... we would have needed a few more centuries for such a technology."</span></p>
  
  <p><span class="comment">Cortana returned the smile.</span><br />
  <span class="spoken cortana">"Well, welcome to the future. Of sorts."</span></p>
  
  <p>I sat down on a kitchen stool, opened one of the dishes, and let it steam. The smell was pleasant... yet strangely alien. I&#x27;m eating rice from a refrigerator in a luxury apartment. 70,000 years in the future.</p>
  
  <p>On a dead planet.</p>
  
  <p>What a fucking day.</p>
