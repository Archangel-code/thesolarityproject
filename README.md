This is a "small" personal project of mine. It started as an idea born out of "The Depressing 2020s / Depression itself), where I began writing my own head-cinema story, something that helped me stay "SANE" over those years, even now.

Now Iâ€™m turning that Headcinema into reality: putting it on my own website. Not at some Fanfic (or similar) Site that comes with sometimes heavy Restrictions, for example with AI. 

All this is only possible with the help of ChatGPT, for not only helping me with building the Wwbsite, but also to learn how to Code.

Maybe it will be successful, maybe not. But letâ€™s see where it goes. ðŸ™‚
