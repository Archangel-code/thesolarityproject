This is a "small" personal project of mine. It started as an idea born out of "The Depressing 2020s / Depression itself), where I began writing my own head-cinema story, something that helped me stay "SANE" over those years, even now.

Now Iâ€™m turning that Headcinema into reality: a website. With the help of ChatGPT and by teaching myself how to code.

Maybe it will be successful, maybe not. But letâ€™s see where it goes. ðŸ™‚
