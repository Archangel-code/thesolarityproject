This is a "small" personal project of mine. It started from daydreams to actual dreams out of "The Depressing 2020s / Depression itself" time, where I simply started tp write this out of nowwhere in early 2025.

Now Iâ€™m turning that Headcinema into reality: putting it on my own website. Not at some Fanfic (or similar) Site that comes with some heavy Restrictions, for example no use of AI. 

All this is only possible with the help of ChatGPT, for not only helping me with writing the story, with building the Website, but also to learn how to Code.

Maybe it will be successful, maybe not. But letâ€™s see where it goes. ðŸ™‚
