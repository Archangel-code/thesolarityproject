  <h1>Chapter 1 – The Fall</h1>

  <div>
  <p>Darkness took over my vision. I could barely open my eyes, as if I were waking from a long coma. Upon opening them, the first thing I saw was the blue sky. A strange feeling... as if my body no longer belonged to me.</p>
  <p>Only when the wind rushed past me did I realize: I was falling. I was falling from the sky. Literally. Panic gripped me. My heart raced, my throat tore open in a scream that vanished into the rush of the fall. The ground came closer—no, not ground... water! An impact.</p>
  <p>Like concrete. My entire body screamed in pain as I went under. Cold. Darkness. Disorientation. I kicked wildly, desperately, until I finally broke the surface. I gasped for air, swallowed salt water, cried, coughed, sobbed. In front of me... a beach. I swam. Every stroke was a struggle. The waves tossed me back and forth as if they wanted to drag me back into the depths. But I fought. I fought with everything I had.</p>
  <p>Then I felt sand beneath my hands. I dragged myself, panting, to the shore. I was there. But where was here? I crawled forward, gasping, until my hands finally felt solid, grainy ground: sand. Damp, warm, salty. I pulled myself inch by inch onto the shore until my body was fully out of the water.</p>
  <p>Then a wave of nausea hit me. I rolled onto my side—and vomited. First just water, then more. It burned in my throat, my nose, my eyes. I spat it out and wiped my mouth with my forearm.</p>
  <p>Then I noticed it. The water was red. I stared at what had just come out of my lungs and slowly turned around.</p>
  <p>The ocean that had spit me out was blood red. But it was clear, not thick or slimy—it moved like normal seawater. Gentle, red-tinted waves rolled against the shore and receded again.</p>
  <p>I hesitated, then crawled slowly back toward the waterline. Every muscle in my body screamed in pain, but my curiosity—or maybe my distrust—was stronger. I bent down low. Smelling. Testing. And then it hit me. A smell—putrid, metallic, bitter. It smelled... like death.</p>
  <p>I recoiled and fell onto my back. My strength was gone. I stared up at the sky and breathed shallowly. But even here I couldn’t stay long. The sun was high. Its rays burned mercilessly on my skin, sharper, more direct, more toxic than usual. My body began to cook, as if I were in an oven. I closed my eyes, hoping for shade, sleep, salvation. Time passed. Maybe minutes. Maybe hours. Eventually I opened my eyes again.</p>
  <p>And there... it stood in the sky: the moon. But something was wrong. I stared at it, blinked, slowly sat up. It was... not gray. Not familiar. Green. With blue patches. I needed a few seconds to process it. And a few more to realize what that meant. That was not my moon.</p>
  <p>And then I saw it—a bit farther off, smaller, but almost identical: a second moon. Two foreign moons. I stood up slowly, my legs shaky, my head heavy.</p>
  <p>I managed only a whisper.</p>
  <p>„Was zum...?“</p>
  <p class="translation">//What the...?//</p>

  <p>I turned around, letting my gaze wander across the beach.</p>
  <p>About ten meters away, a small sand dune rose. Instinctively, I headed for it. Every step took effort, but something drove me—curiosity, or maybe the fear of never understanding what was happening to me. I climbed the dune.</p>
  <p>At the top, I stopped. Before me stretched a wide, quiet sandy landscape, crisscrossed with large, sweeping dunes. And then, on the horizon—as if from a dream—I saw it: a metropolis. Kilometers away, buildings reached into the sky that I could only describe as utopian. Smooth, shimmering towers lined with light strips. Floating platforms moved between them, and the whole scene looked... not of this Earth.</p>
  <p>I stared. My heart raced. My mind reeled. And then it clicked.</p>
  <p>„Ich bin definitiv nicht auf der Erde.“</p>
  <p class="translation">//I am definitely not on Earth.//</p>

  <div class="timejump">[Hours later]</div>

  <p>The sun sank lower and lower, and its rays now seemed gentler, as if it had lost its rage. At first, the city seemed within reach, as if I could get there in minutes. But the longer I walked, the more I realized: it was farther than it appeared—because of its size. The buildings weren't just large. They were gigantic. With every step, more details came into view: the architecture was a mix of the familiar and the unknown. Some towers looked like modern glass structures from my world—slim, reflective, elegant. Others seemed to flow, as if grown rather than built. Their surfaces shimmered in colors I couldn’t name, with geometric patterns that seemed to shift ever so slightly.</p>
  <p>„Definitiv nicht meine Erde“, I murmured.</p>
  <p class="translation">//Definitely not my Earth.//</p>

  <p>It sounded almost like a conclusion. Or a verdict. I noticed that the path was slowly inclining. The city seemed to lie on a raised plateau—perhaps a hill, perhaps man-made. I followed the gentle ascent, step by step, my eyes repeatedly fixed on the city.</p>
  <p>Then I saw it. Something blocked the way. A wall. Massive, metallic, smooth. About ten meters high, completely unmarked. No gates, no windows, no banners. Just a flat surface, beyond which the lower buildings of the metropolis rose.</p>
  <p>But what was truly strange was what lay before the wall. I stepped closer—and then I saw it. Sun loungers. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. Seats, benches, small huts that looked like cocktail bars from a tropical vacation catalog. And although I couldn’t see anyone, everything looked... used.</p>

  <p>I turned around, looked back at the sea. And only then did I notice it. The water... was gone. Not just vanished, but receded. Far, far back. What I had walked across before—that wasn’t the real beach. This place, full of sun loungers and huts, was the real beach.</p>
  <p>I stood at the edge of a strange, foreign, silent vacation idyll. And beyond the wall: an alien world. I stepped closer to the loungers. The fabrics were faded, some torn. The padding underneath slightly dented, as if someone had sat there... a long time ago.</p>

  <p>The small bars also looked abandoned. Their counters were covered in a fine layer of sand that had gathered in cracks and corners. Glasses still stood there—clouded by dust, half-filled with dried, cracked remnants. The floor crunched under my steps. No trash, no decay—just age. The whole scene looked like a frozen moment from another time. As if there had once been life here. Lots of life.</p>

  <p>I turned around—and something became clear. The sea that had washed me ashore was not, as expected, directly behind me. No. It was... far away. Kilometers away. A shimmering red band on the horizon. What I had first taken for the edge of the beach was just the dry, abandoned forefield. The actual beach began here.</p>
  <p>Sun loungers, seating areas, huts—all built on solid ground, far from the water. And yet—everything looked as if the sea had once reached right here. I walked on, silently, attentively. The wind carried fine sand in spirals through the deserted complex. Minutes passed as I wandered through this no-man’s-land of empty vacation dreams.</p>

  <p>Then I saw it. A staircase. Wide, elegant, made of a light, metallic-gloss material. It ran directly along the wall upward. A clear, straight path. Leading directly to the city.</p>
  <p>I stopped. Stared at it. My heartbeat quickened as I slowly approached the first steps. Was this the way in? The staircase seemed endless. The path upward had no railing, no sign, no sound—only silence.</p>

  <p>Somewhere halfway up, I paused. My legs felt heavy, my head throbbed. I turned to the side, slowly sat on one of the steps, and leaned against the smooth wall behind me. The cold stone felt foreign—just like everything here.</p>
  <p>I closed my eyes. Took a breath. Gradually, the thoughts came. First softly. Then louder.</p>

  <p>„Wie um alles in der...im Universum bin ich hier gelandet?“</p>
  <p class="translation">//How...in the universe did I end up here?//</p>

  <p>There it still was in the sky—the foreign moon. Green. With blue patches. Vegetative. I stared at it. Tried to understand it. And then... something came back.</p>
